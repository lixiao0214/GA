tournament(originalparents, couplenum, subsetnum, fitness)
}
\arguments{
\item{originalparents}{a casenum * variablenum matrix}

\item{couplenum}{number of couples selected}

\item{subsetnum}{partition the set of chromosomes in generation t into "subsetnum" disjoint subsets}

\item{fitness}{goodness of fit ~ a casenum * 1 vector , default is AICvalue}
}
\value{
Returns the selected parents ~ list
}
\description{
the set of parents in generation t is randomly partitioned into k disjoint
subsets of equal size(perhaps with a few remaining parents temporarily ignored)
The best individual in each group is chosen as a parent.
Additional random partitionings are carried out until sufficient parents have
been generated.Parents are then paired randomly for breeding.
