Three different methods are provided: "twopropselection", "onepropselection" and "tournament"}
\usage{
selectparents(originalparents, couplenum, method, fitness, subsetnum = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{originalparents}{is a casenum * variablenum matrix}

\item{couplenum}{number of couples selected}

\item{method}{the method to select the parents, "twopropselection", "onepropselection" or "tournament"}

\item{fitness}{goodness of fit ~ a casenum * 1 vector , default is AICvalue}

\item{subsetnum}{In method "tournament", we partition the set of chromosomes in generation t into "subsetnum" disjoint subsets}
